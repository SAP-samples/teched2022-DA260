Estimated time: 20 minutes

## Objective

With this exercise you explore some of the features for master data quality management offered by SAP Master Data Governance, cloud edition (MDG Cloud). You will see how data quality rules for validation of master data are managed and how you can control their usage in master data processes. You will use the Evaluation Results app to analyze the results of a data quality evaluation and see how you can fix detected errors.
