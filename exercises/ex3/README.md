# Chapter 2 - Consolidation of business partner master data

Estimated time: 30 minutes

## Objective

A single source of truth for master data is essential. SAP Master Data Governance lets you integrate data from SAP and non-SAP systems or other sources to reach this goal. In this chapter, you will learn the basics for working with the consolidation capabilities of SAP Master Data Governance. You will start with the import of source data in spreadsheet format and the creation of a consolidation process. Then you will examine the results of each process step. Furthermore, you will learn how to use the match review to understand the result of matching and how to work with match groups and the result of the best record calculation.
