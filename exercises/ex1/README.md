# Chapter 1 - Request & Approve Material Creation

Estimated time: 30 minutes

## Objective

Explore basic features of central governance of master data in SAP MDG, such as multi-person workflows, change request processing, data quality validation, approval and the concept of data staging and activation.

## Exercise Description

This exercise is split in 3 parts. It is required to perform each step after the other.

- Exercise 1.1: As a business user, access the system, search for a material and since you do not find it, request the creation of a new material.
- Exercise 1.2: As a master data specialist, pick up the change request workflow, provide additional material views and attributes or correct erroneous data and then send the request for approval.
- Exercise 1.3: As a master data expert, check and approve the request to finalize the creation of a new material in perfect quality.

Please note that besides the short exercise description there is also a detailed [step-by-step description](../supplements/DA260_Exercises_Solutions.pdf) provided.

### Exercise 1.1: Logon, search and then request a new material

In this exercise, you will be a business user requesting a new material. You will send an SAP MDG Change Request which shall be further processed by other users in your company.

### Exercise 1.2: Process and enhance the material request

You will now switch roles. In exercise 1.1 you were the business user requesting the material. In exercise 1.2 you will be the master data specialist working on the completion of the master data record. In a real business environment, a different person would execute the following tasks. For simplicity of this workshop, you will also execute these tasks using the same system user.

### Exercise 1.3: Approve the request and activate the new material

In this exercise, you will be the third person involved in the process. As a master data expert, you are in charge to ensure that only high-quality data makes it into the production systems. Again, although this would be a different person in a real business environment, you will also execute these tasks using the same system user.
